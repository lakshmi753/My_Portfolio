            I learned that Computer Science is not just about Syntax and Coding.
            We can make a Difference in people's lives by Developing
            Applications.
          </p>
          <p class="hidden">
            I try to learn certain areas of Computer Science exhaustively, then
            I try to digest that Knowledge into a form that is Accessible to
            people who don't have time for such study
          </p>
          <p class="">
            The most important skill for a Computer Scientist is
            Problem-Solving. Even if you don't know all the Details of the
            Technology you are using, if you can Solve the problem, you can
            figure out how to do it.

            Hello, my name is Lakshmi Sahu. I studied from SN SEN Girls Collage,
            in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh. Currently I'm learning Frontend
            Development and actively applying for Frontend Developer role in
            many companies. Before that I was preparing for UPSC as I wanted to
            be an IAS from my childhood. Just to pursue my dream of being an IAS
            I opted Arts and Humanities in my Graduation and followed BA in
            Political Science. But I was also a student of Computer Science, as
            I opted Computer Science in my 11th and 12th standard. It was in
            11th itself when I came to know about Web Development and from that
            moment I wanted to learn web Development. So, I decided to pursue
            Web Development even in case where I can able to clear UPSC and also
            as Plan B in case I can't. Today I'm learning Web Development as
            Plan B and really enjoying learning different technologies,
            different approaches of solving Real time problems and above all I
            really enjoy working on different projects as every project taught
            me some new concepts, some new ways of handling problems and really
            amazes me about Web Development.
