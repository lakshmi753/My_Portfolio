            I learned that Computer Science is not just about Syntax and Coding.
            We can make a Difference in people's lives by Developing
            Applications.

          <p class="hidden">
            I try to learn certain areas of Computer Science exhaustively, then
            I try to digest that Knowledge into a form that is Accessible to
            people who don't have time for such study

            The most important skill for a Computer Scientist is
            Problem-Solving. Even if you don't know all the Details of the
            Technology you are using, if you can Solve the problem, you can
            figure out how to do it.
