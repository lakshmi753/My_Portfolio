            I learned that Computer Science is not just about Syntax and Coding.

            I try to learn certain areas of Computer Science exhaustively, then

          <p class="quotes hidden">
            The most important skill for a Computer Scientist is
            Problem-Solving. Even if you don't know all the Details of the
            Technology you are using, if you can Solve the problem, you can
            figure out how to do it.

            Hello, my name is Lakshmi Sahu. I studied from SN SEN Girls Collage,
            in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh. Currently I'm learning Frontend
            Development and actively applying for Frontend Developer role in
            many companies. Before that I was preparing for UPSC as I wanted to
            be an IAS from my childhood. Just to pursue my dream of being an IAS
            I opted Arts and Humanities in my Graduation and followed BA in
            Political Science. But I was also a student of Computer Science, as
            I opted Computer Science in my 11th and 12th standard. It was in
            11th itself when I came to know about Web Development and from that
            moment I wanted to learn web Development. So, I decided to pursue
            Web Development even in case where I can able to clear UPSC and also
            as Plan B in case I can't. Today I'm learning Web Development as
            Plan B and really enjoying learning different technologies,
            different approaches of solving Real time problems and above all I
            really enjoy working on different projects as every project taught
            me some new concepts, some new ways of handling problems and really
            amazes me about Web Development.

                This project is a Todo List app, which is made using Html, Css
                and Javascript. In which we can schedule ours daily tasks. The
                app uses "local storage" to keep track of our tasks . The second
                top heading of the app keeps the count of total number of tasks.
                After that we have a 'text-area' where we can enter our desired
                tasks and along with it we have a button 'create task' which
                when clicked displays our task along with the date and time of
                the created task. We can edit and remove the task from the app
                using 'remove' button but only when the task is marked as
                "done". At the end we have a "clear list" button which gives us
                the option to clear the whole list at once but first makes sure
                wheather user really want to clear the list.

                This project is a popular "Hangman-game", which everyone of us
                has definitely played once or more. This project is made using
                Html, Css and Javascript. Here I'm using self-create array of
                "words and hints" required for the game and randomly getting
                words along with there hints every time the game starts. Six
                chances were given for incorrect guess and with each incorrect
                guess our hangman image also get updated. After losing all the
                six chances there appears a overlay over which we can see a
                small pop-up having losing-gif, correct-word and a "play again"
                button, clicking which we can start the game again. The most
                facinating thing about this project is that in this project we
                are creating a keyboard using "String.fromCharCode()" method.

                This project is a "Countdown timer", which is built using
                "React". Here we are required to enter the end date along with
                time in the input field and click the "set timer" button to
                start the Timer. We can also "reset" the Timer by clicking on
                the "Reset timer" button. I saw a countdown timer app in
                javascript which simply shows the timer but without user setting
                the date and time. But taking inspiration from that app I build
                this "CountDown Timer" app on my own in both "Javascript" and
                "React". With a cool feature of user setting the timer as per
                their requirement and can also reset it when they need. It's a
                "user-friendly" timer and I really enjoyed building this app.

                This project is a "Dice-Roll game", which is built using React.
                In React I used "useReducer hook" for all the calculations and
                state management. This game requires two players, at the
                starting Player-1 is the active player and roll the dice first
                by clicking on the "roll" button. The number on the dice become
                the "Current score" , player-1 can also "hold" with which
                "player-2" become active player and can roll the dice. If dice
                rolled "1" then also active palyer get switched. The player
                scoring 100 scores first wins the game. After the game get over
                only "new game" button appears clicking on which we can restart
                the game. I saw this game in Javascript but then tried it with
                React while I was learning "useReducer hook" as this app seems
                the right fit for practicing "useReducer" hook.

                This project is almost a YouTube clone, which is made using Html
                and Css only. In this project I focused totally on making this
                app look as similar to Original YouTube app as possible. All the
                icons used on the header and sidebar are just similar, including
                the youtube logo. As "anchor tags" are used in this app we can
                open the provided videos by clicking on the video image and also
                on the video's title. Similarly we can also open the channel by
                clicking on the profile pic and channel name. I made this
                project after learning Html and Css and really enjoyed learning
                and applying different css properties and html knowledge in this
                project.
