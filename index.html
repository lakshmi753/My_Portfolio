            Hello, my name is Lakshmi Sahu. I studied from SN SEN Girls Collage,
            in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh. Currently I'm learning Frontend
            Development and actively applying for Frontend Developer role in
            many companies. Before that I was preparing for UPSC as I wanted to
            be an IAS from my childhood. Just to pursue my dream of being an IAS
            I opted Arts and Humanities in my Graduation and followed BA in
            Political Science. But I was also a student of Computer Science, as
            I opted Computer Science in my 11th and 12th standard. It was in
            11th itself when I came to know about Web Development and from that
            moment I wanted to learn web Development. So, I decided to pursue
            Web Development even in case where I can able to clear UPSC and also
            as Plan B in case I can't. Today I'm learning Web Development as
            Plan B and really enjoying learning different technologies,
            different approaches of solving Real time problems and above all I
            really enjoy working on different projects as every project taught
            me some new concepts, some new ways of handling problems and really
            amazes me about Web Development.

                  I saw a countdown timer app in javascript which simply shows
                  the timer but without user setting the date and time. But
                  taking inspiration from that app I build this "CountDown
                  Timer" app on my own in both "Javascript" and "React".
